/// Current version of the pypp library.
///
/// This package uses the Semantic Versioning scheme:
///
///   <http://semver.org/>
///
/// Major versions introduce significant changes to the API, and backwards
/// compatibility is not guaranteed. Minor versions are for new features and
/// other backwards-compatible changes to the API. Patch versions are for bug
/// fixes and internal code changes that do not affect the API. If a devel
/// version number is defined this is an incomplete development version of a
/// patch release.
///
/// Version 0.x should be considered a development version with an unstable
/// API, and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed for minor releases.
